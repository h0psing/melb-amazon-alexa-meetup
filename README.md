# Step 1: Create Alexa Skill

As a first step, we're going to create an Alexa Skill and introduce you to key components: 
Innovation name
Intents
Utteranes

We're going to need to configure both our Alexa skill and AWS, which will require a bit of back and forth between the two services. Let's start on AWS' side as we'll need to get our server running before we can configure our Alexa skill.
