# Getting Started: Develop an Amazon Alexa Skill

# Who are we?
Welcome to the [Melbourne Amazon Alexa Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Amazon-Alexa-Meetup) workshop: Getting Started: Develop an Amazon Alexa Skill.

# What is this?
This repo contains code and instructions to build an Amazon Alexa Skill with Node JS code hosted on AWS (Lambda).  It is split into 3 branches, each containing instructions for the stages to get an Alexa skill published.

## What is an Alexa skill?
Alexa is Amazon's voice service and the brain behind millions of devices including Amazon Echo. Alexa provides capabilities, or skills, that enable customers to create a more personalised experience. There are now thousands of skills available in Australia and New Zealand, from brands like Qantas, Westpac, Sky TV, NAB, Taste.com.au, hipages, Dimmi, SBS News, as well as innovative designers and developers.

This app will give you an overview of the following components:
- [Utternaces]
- [Intents]

## AWS config:

This app will use 2 AWS' services:
- [Alexa Developer](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa): Alexa Developer is Amazon's platform that is used to publish Alexa Skills.
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda): AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.

# Get Started:

## What you'll need
- An AWS account allowing you to create a new Alexa Skill and Lambdas
